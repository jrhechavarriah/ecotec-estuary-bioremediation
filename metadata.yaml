description: This dataset contains 176 high-resolution observations of water quality
  variables collected from a five-station estuarine monitoring program near ECOTEC
  University (Guayaquil, Ecuador) between January 2024 and June 2025. It supports
  microbial bioremediation assessment using spatially distributed disturbance–recovery
  interventions.
